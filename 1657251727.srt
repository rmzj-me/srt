爸爸!
Dad!

3
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,539
你粗鲁的混蛋!
You rude bastard!

4
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,740
对不起，我要砍了你。
Sorry but I'll slash you.

5
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:41,539
什么……
What...

6
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:47,039
嘿，你知道戴这种面具的武士吗?
Hey, do you know the samurais wearing this kind of mask?

7
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:49,039
你这个混蛋。
You bastard.

8
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,520
你从哪儿弄来的?
Where did you get that?

9
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,719
看来我终于找到你了。
It seems I finally found you.

10
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,939
哈!
Huh!

11
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:03,600
你到底是谁?
Who the hell are you?

12
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,379
一坂博，武士杀手。
Ichibanboshi, the samurai killer.

13
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,159
我来了!
Here I come!

14
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,379
(日本武士杀手一坂博)
(Ichibanboshi, the samurai killer)

15
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,879
你的生活…
Your life...

16
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,500
将奉献给我们的国家!
Will be dedicated to our country!

17
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,939
“我们的国家”什么?
What "our country"?

18
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,540
都怪你们这些混蛋
All is blamed on you bastards,

19
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,819
现在大家都糊涂了!
everyone is confused now!

20
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,500
你被捕了!
(Police) You are under arrest!

21
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,659
(警察)不要动!
(Police) Don't move!

22
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,099
该死的!让我走!
Damn! Let me go!

23
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,379
早在我出生之前，
Long before I was born,

24
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,099
某个来自某个地方的人把这个世界搞得一团糟。
someone from somewhere made this world into a total shit.

25
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:32,859
在这个糟糕的世界里，
In this shitty world,

26
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,840
到处都臭得像屎，到处都是屎。
everywhere always stinks like shit and filled with shit.

27
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,500
因此，武士就是武士，农民就是农民。
Therefore, samurais are samurais, peasants are peasants.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,540
那些悲惨的，只是悲惨地死去。
Those miserable, just die miserably.

29
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,840
这一定是个玩笑。我在哪儿?
This must be a joke. Where am I?

30
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,959
看来我的心脏还在跳。
Well, it seems my heart is still beating.

31
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:04,920
我们能在冥河吗?
Could we be at the Styx?

32
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,539
到底!我们像鱼一样被捆住了!
What the heck! We are tied up like a fish!

33
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,360
嗯?
Huh?

34
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,360
谁……
Who...

35
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:12,939
是吗?
Are you?

36
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,639
我是新团八队的队长
I am the captain of team 8 of Shinsengumi

37
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:19,300
(新圣团8队队长，东藤平介)原名Mibu Roshigumi，
(Captain of Team 8 of Shinsengumi, Todo Heisuke) formerly called Mibu Roshigumi,

38
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:21,680
Todo Heisuke。
Todo Heisuke.

39
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,080
那个该死的新宫武士?
Huh, the shit samurai from Shinsengumi?

40
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,539
你没有资格鄙视一个武士，一坨屎。
There is no qualification to despise a samurai for you, a sack full of shit.

41
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,199
突然什么…
Suddenly what...

42
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,800
那个混蛋好像从他嘴里吐了些蛆。
The shit sack seems to have spit some maggots from his mouth.

43
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,319
你为什么带我们来这里?
Why did you take us here?

44
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,460
快速地把它说清楚。
Make it clear quickly.

45
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,379
你要杀了我们这些本该被砍头的人吗?
Are you going to kill us who were supposed to be beheaded?

46
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:52,819
在8月18日的政治变革中，
In the political change on August 18th,

47
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,900
新团的高管们
the executives of Shinsengumi,

48
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,319
包括近藤Isami导演，都被人暗杀了。
including Director Kondo Isami, were all assassinated by someone.

49
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,000
导演!Hijikata !
Director! Hijikata!

50
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:04,759
每个人都…
Everyone...

51
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:11,340
你们今天都被判了死刑。
You all were sentenced to death today.

52
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,639
所以你们都死了，然后复活成为新团的高管。
So you all died and resurrected as Shinsengumi executives.

53
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,120
你是说，像个政治诱饵?
You mean, like a political decoy?

54
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,199
因为真实的那个人已经死了，
As the authentic person has died already,

55
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:22,639
是吗?
Eh?

56
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,599
“替代品”不是更准确吗?
Isn't "a substitute" more accurate?

57
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:26,539
作为替代品，
Acting as the substitutes,

58
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,539
如果新统能坚持下去
if Shinsengumi can keep on,

59
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,020
你的死刑将被免除。
your death penalty will be written off.

60
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,139
如果你拒绝,
If you refuse,

61
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,120
你知道了这个秘密就不能活下去了。
you can not be kept alive having known the secret.

62
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,240
如果我们拒绝，就会被处死。
Execution as it is if we refuse.

63
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,080
所以你选择了罪犯。
That's why you chose the criminals.

64
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,680
多么不合理的策略……
What an unreasonable strategy...

65
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:45,099
从一个逆境到另一个逆境……
From one adversity to another...

要么死在这里，要么当替补。

71
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,400
shinengumi是做什么的?
What dose Shinsengumi do?

72
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,139
在松平·片森大人的命令下，
Under the order from Lord Matsudaira Katamori,

73
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,139
维护首都公共秩序。
maintain public order of the capital.

74
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,699
我们需要砍人吗?
Do we need to cut somebody down?

75
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,659
是的。
Yes.

76
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:09,759
我把它。
I take it.

77
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,400

你就这样加入了新团?
You just join Shinsengumi like this?

80
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,839
我只擅长砍人。
I'm only good at slashing people.

81
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,480
只要我杀人还能赚钱，作为新团或刺客，
As long as I get paid for killing people, as a Shinsengumi or an assassin,

82
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:27,259
这是相同的。
it's the same.

83

(Sakuya暗杀者)
(Sakuya, the assassinator)

84
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,639
到目前为止，作为一名杀手，我遵守了规则，
So far I have followed the rules as an assassin,

85
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,300
作为新圣美的我现在应该遵循什么?
What should I follow now as Shinsengumi?

86
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,139
我。Todo Heisuke是这里的规矩。
Me. Todo Heisuke is the rule here.

87
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,399
明白了。
Got it.

事实上，我没有理由拒绝。

101

我还没喝够酒，
I have not gotten enough with drinks,

102
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,790
(犯罪收集者嘉塔鲁)女人还是赌博!

103
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:23,160
愚蠢的剑客!
Stupid Shinsengumi!

104
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,279
即使我腐烂了，我也只侍奉陛下。
I serve only His Majesty even if I rot.

105
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:27,620
我永远不会成为巴库夫的走狗。
I will never be the running dog of Bakufu.

106
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,939
第808届…
The 808th...

107
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,560
我做错了什么吗?
Did I do anything wrong?

108
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:39,980
不,它很好。
No, it's fine.

109
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,759
我就录下七泽神摩死于意外。
I'll just record that Serizawa Kamo died of accident.

110
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,579
该死的武士，你把人的生命当什么?
Damn samurais, what do you take people's lives as?

111
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,740
哈哈!从某种意义上说，这是一个比监狱更糟糕的地方。
Haha! Here's a even worse place than the prison in a sense.

112
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,680
这可能是一个愚蠢的问题，但是……
This may be a foolish question, but...

113
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,980
我可以拥有这具尸体吗?
Is it okay for me to have this corpse?

114
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,160
无论什么。
Whatever.

为了那些无法安息的灵魂，

124
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,680
总得有人为他们祈祷，对吧?

我有一件事要确认。
I have one thing to confirm.

127
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,399
我真的可以代替秋田宗二吗
Is it really okay for me to be a substitute for Okita Soji

128
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,199
作为一个女人吗?
as a woman?

129
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,879
W…女人?
W...Woman?

130
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:38,740
新统完全是精英主义。
It's completely meritocratic in Shinsengumi.

131
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,639
这只是你作为女人的问题。
It's only your problem of being a woman.

132
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,980
明白了。我也在。

135
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:53,160
我在伪装。
I'm in disguise.

136
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,600
无论是剑术还是知识，
No matter in Kenjutsu or in knowledge,

137
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,980
我不会输给男人!

(Akira，一个伪装成男性的女囚犯)

139
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,120
我从守卫那里听说你曾是剑术教练。

00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,420
我才不要当什么狗屁武士!
I won't be a shit samurai!

00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,079
跑,你所有!
Run, you all!

153
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:43,819
啊!
Ah!

154
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,620
——爸爸!——亲爱的!
- Dad! - Darling!

155
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,680
Ichibanboshi !
Ichibanboshi!

156
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,420
住在……
Live on...

157
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:10,759
什么“改变历史”?
What "change the history"?!

158
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:14,759
你们这些拿着剑的混蛋，无辜的杀人犯怎么敢说这些崇高的废话!
How dare you sword-equipped bastards, murders of innocence say those lofty bullshit!

159
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:18,259
我最恨武士!
I hate samurais the most!

160
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,459
就是那个武士戴的奇怪面具…
Is the weird mask that samurai wore...

161
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,139
像这样的吗?
like this?

162
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:29,879
是吗?
Eh?

163
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,660
你从哪儿弄来的…
Where did you get that...

164
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:35,820
这是杀害新团干部的人的面具。
This is the mask of those who killed the executives of Shinsengumi.

165
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,120
它来自一个叫Zomennooni的组织。
It's from an organization called Zomennooni.

166
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,080
真巧，我们有同样的敌人。
What a coincidence, we have the same enemies.

167
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,320
shinengumi在找Zomennooni。
Shinsengumi is looking for that Zomennooni.

168
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,200
你也找到它们了吗?
Do you also find them too?

169
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,299
是的。
Yes.

170
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,340
新统一定会消灭扎门努尼，为死者报仇。
Shinsengumi will definitely destroy Zomennooni and avenge the dead.

171
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,919
你也想报仇吗?
Do you also want to avenge?

172
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,899
当然!我一定会为我的家人报仇的!
Of course! I will avenge my families for sure!

173
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:01,940
好!
Good!

174
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,919
这是长曾根·冲进·纽道·高铁。
This is Nagasone Okisato Nyudo Kotetsu.

175
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,399
它现在是近藤Isami导演珍爱的宝剑。
It is now Director Kondo Isami's cherished sword.

176
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,960
你会拿起这把剑，变成近藤Isami吗?
Will you take this sword and become Kondo Isami?

177
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:28,539
为了报复我的家人，
To take a revenge for my families,

178
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,679
我愿意做任何事!
I will do anything!

179
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,600
甚至成为一个该死的武士!
Even become a shit samurai!

180
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,019
我…
I...

181
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,440
我将……
I will...

182
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,779
成为科多兽Isami !
Become Kodo Isami!

183
00:09:56,139 --> 00:10:00,639
(照!Bakumatsu坏男孩)
(Shine On! Bakumatsu Bad Boys)

184
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,049
(爱祖总部、近开口诀)
(Headquarter of Aizu, Konkaikoumyouji)

185
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:17,480
(野祖领地领主，松平片森)
(Lord of Aizu Domain, Matsudaira Katamori)

186
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,769
(野祖领地领主，松平片森)Todo，替换计划进行得怎么样了?
(Lord of Aizu Domain, Matsudaira Katamori) How is the substitutes plan going , Todo?

187
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:22,120
他们今天加入了我们。
They joined us today.

188
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,360
首都的公共秩序一天比一天差。
The public order in the capital is getting worse everyday.

189
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,460
为了不增加不满的浪人的数量，
So as not to increase the number of malcontent ronins,

190
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,799
新统现在不能解散。
Shinsengumi shall not be disbanded now.

191
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,799
这是另一个累人的任务，但是
This is another tiring task but

192
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,120
请照顾和培训他们。
please take care of and train them.

193
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,320
是的!我会严格指导他们。
Yes! I will instruct them strictly.

194
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,259
Chomp的声响。
Chomp, chomp.

195
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,259
来吧，我们已经有这么好的胳膊了，我们应该……
Come on, we already got some decent arm like this, how long should we...

196
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,200
只有白痴才会玩剑。
Only idiots play with a sword.

197
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,259
烦人的!
Annoying!

198
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:50,840
是吗?
Eh?

199
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,779
那个小男孩去哪儿了?
Where did that little boy go?

200
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,700
东藤去找片森大人。
Todo went for Lord Katamori.

201
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:57,960
那是谁?
Who is that?

202
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,440
他是御津郡京都的军事特派员。
He is the Military Commissioner of Kyoto from Aizu Domain.

203
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,919
他是我们的主。记住，你这个白痴。
He's our lord. Remember that, you idiot.

204
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:07,159
你个混蛋，你叫我白痴已经有一段时间了。
You bastard, you've been calling me idiot for a while now.

205
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:07,899
停止。
Stop.

206
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:08,620
啊?
Ah?

207
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,919
让我们开始训练。
Let's start training.

208
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:13,440
Katamori勋爵
Lord Katamori,

209
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:14,340
(相津域Koyokata, Akizuki Teijiro) [Koyokata:日本幕府时期的官职]
(Aizu Domain Koyokata, Akizuki Teijiro) [Koyokata: An official position in Japan during the Bakufu Time]

210
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,419
(Aizu域顾问，Akizuki Teijiro)与其依赖没有高管的新统，
(Aizu Domain Counsellor, Akizuki Teijiro) Rather than relying on Shinsengumi without executives,

211
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:19,000
(相津域参赞，秋月泰二郎)Bakufu拥有的Mimawarigumi怎么样?
(Aizu Domain Counsellor, Akizuki Teijiro) how about the Mimawarigumi owned by Bakufu?

212
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,679
秋月，Mimawarigumi不是正在召集追随者吗?
Akizuki, isn't Mimawarigumi right in middle of rallying immediate followers?

213
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,500
我们现在只能依靠新统了。
We can only rely on Shinsengumi now.

214
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,419
这是一个遗憾，但这就是现在日渐衰弱的Bakufu的现状。
It's a shame but that is the actualities of the now languishing Bakufu.

215
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,659
所以，不要太依赖罪犯。
Todo, don't rely too much on the criminals.

216
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,960
这足以让德百叶家族暂时受到惊吓。
It's enough to keep the prestige to scare the Tobakuha for a while.

217
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,259
我非常感激你的好意。
I appreciate your kindness very much.

218
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,940
我一定会恢复新统。
I will definitely restore Shinsengumi.

219
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,679
确保首都的公共秩序…
And secure the public order of the capital...

220
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:52,059
你们有人学过剑术吗?
Has anyone of you learned about Kenjutsu?

221
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:53,799
不。
No.

222
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,440
我用这个。
I use this.

223
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,000
我用这个。
I with this.

224
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,860
僧侣们从来没有杀死。
Monks never kill.

225
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,039
火药更有效。
Well, gunpowder is more efficient.

226
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,600
我忍不住担心未来。
I can't help worrying about the future...

227
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:12,779
新统以诚为旗，汇聚各种身份的人，
Shinsengumi, gathering people with various status, takes Sincerity as the flag,

228
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,840
以武士道为准则
and Bushido as the rule.

229
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,539
因此，剑术不可忽视。
Therefore, Kenjutsu cannot be neglected.

230
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,399
现在让我们来一场Jigeiko的较量。[竖井子:剑道术语，指自由练习]
Now let's have a bout as Jigeiko. [Jigeiko: a Kendo term for free practice]

231
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,440
近藤!
Kondo!

232
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:24,039
近藤局长。
Director Kondo.

233
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:26,480
啊,是我。
Ah, it's me.

234
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,659
好吧，我们开始吧!
Okay, let's do it!

235
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:33,000
不用考虑，放马过来吧。
No consideration, bring it on.

236
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,340
我不用这样的东西。
I don't use such a thing.

237
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:42,179
那就不是练习了。
Hey, then it won't be a practice.

238
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:44,440
关键是要赢，对吧?
The thing is to win, right?

239
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,080
赢了!
Win!

240
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:49,860
我下令调查面具的事。
I ordered investigations about the mask.

241
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,860
它似乎和能乐有关。
It seems to be related to Nogaku.

242
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:53,320
Nogaku吗?
Nogaku?

243
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,179
如果是稀有的东西，
If it's something rare,

244
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:57,360
要找到它并不难。
it won't be hard to track it down.

245
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,679
我们也将继续调查。
We will also keep investigating.

246
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,659
我真的很感激。
I really appreciate it sincerely.

247
00:14:02,419 --> 00:14:03,779
待办事项。
Well, Todo.

248
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,039
我听说浪人在岛原和祗园游荡。
I heard that ronins were wandering around in Shimabara and Gion.

249
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,019
我会尽快下令逮捕他。
I will order the arrest as soon as possible.

250
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:13,980
把木剑捡起来!
Pick up the wooden sword!

251
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:16,519
我要用我自己的方式战斗!
I will fight in my own way!

252
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,320
我很惊讶他居然用那玩意打架。
I am surprised that he fights with that.

253
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:20,820
从另一个角度来说，这令人印象深刻。
In another way, that's impressive.

254
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,960
为什么他是近藤导演?
Why is he Director Kondo?

255
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,659
嗯?
Huh?

256
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,899
愚蠢的博世……
Stupid Boshi...

257
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:31,620
停!
Stop!

258
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:43,299
你这个笨蛋!
You idiot!

259
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,700
你在干什么!
What are you doing!

260
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:50,200
你脑子里有浆糊吗，你这个烂面包!
Is there any paste stuck in your brain, you rotten bun!

261
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,580
剑是武士的灵魂。
The sword is the soul of a samurai.

262
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,580
而不是扔在地上的东西!
Not something thrown away on the ground!

263
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,679
我讨厌剑。
I hate swords.

264
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:59,399
这个烂屌丝太得意忘形了。
The shitty loser have got carried away.

265
00:14:59,440 --> 00:14:59,840
什么!
What!

266
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,899
你应该毫不考虑地打他。
You should have hit him without any consideration.

267
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:03,759
但是…
But...

268
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,059
我们要对抗的对手不是那些踢就能打败的对手。
The opponents we will fight are not those can be defeated just by kicks.

269
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,840
你有为家人报仇的意愿吗?
Do you even have the will to avenge your family?

270
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,240
我知道。
I know.

271
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,259
一旦我开始练剑术，我就会立刻成为其中的佼佼者。
As soon as I start with Kenjutsu, I will become the best among them immediately.

272
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,759
大家准备好!
Get ready, you all!

273
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,940
第一个作品来了!
Here comes the first work!

274
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,139
从现在开始，在城里巡逻
From now on, patrol the city

275
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,840
逮捕罪犯!
and arrest the criminals!

276
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,440
太棒了!我要砸烂它们!
Great! I will smash them!

277
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:41,220
粉碎……?
Smash...?

278
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:42,679
粉碎他们!
Smash them!

279
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:46,399
有被砸的猎物吗?
Is there any prey for the smashing thing?

280
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,259
当然可以。
Of course.

281
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,759
阿基拉，你以前摔过吗?
Akira, have you ever smashed before?

282
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,039
不，我也从来没有砸过……
No, I have also never smashed...

283
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:55,220
粉碎……它是德国吗?
Smash... Is it Germany?

284
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:57,139
谁在乎!这是逮捕行动!
Who cares! This is an arrest op!

285
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,899
以有实际经验者为中心，分为三个小组。
Divide into three teams centered on those with actual experiences.

286
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,259
嘉塔鲁，布和我去祗园。
Gyatarou, Bou and I will go to Gion.

287
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:06,240
罗杰!
Roger!

288
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,000
Akira, Sogen, Suzuran，你们去Arasuma。
Akira, Sogen, Suzuran, you go to Arasuma.

289
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:09,960
罗杰!
Roger!

290
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:11,799
左边的一坂博和佐库……
The left Ichibanboshi and Saku...

291
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:12,580
嘿!
Hey!

292
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,580
我为什么要和他在一起!
Why do I have to be with him?!

293
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:16,879
Sakuya，你很坚强。
Sakuya, you are strong.

294
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,100
即使驮着一只小狗到处乱叫乱跑，
Even with a burden puppy yapping and running around,

295
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:21,740
你还能应付的，对吧?
you still can deal with it, right?

296
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:23,860
谁是小狗?
Who is a puppy?!

297
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,500
你是狗!
You are the dog!

298
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,139
不仅Ichibanboshi。
Not only Ichibanboshi.

299
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,639
你还不是剑道专家。

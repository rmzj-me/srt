00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,080
嗯?
Huh?

147
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:06,200
我很抱歉。事实上，我不知道。
I-I'm sorry. Actually, I have no idea about it.

148
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,460
——嗯?我是偶然得到这张票的。
- Huh? - I got this ticket by chance.

149
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,779
所以我觉得应该会很有趣……
So I thought it should be interesting...

150
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,659
哈哈,我明白了。
Haha, I see.

151
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,639
我还是很高兴你对这个展览感兴趣。
I'm still very happy that you're interested in this exhibition.

152
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:23,700
红色数据动物是什么样的动物?
What kind of animal is the red data animal?

153
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,500
哦。
Oh.

154
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:28,559
这是一种可能很快就要灭绝的动物。
It's a kind of animal that may become extinct soon.

155
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,720
是吗?灭绝了吗?
Eh? Extinct?

156
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,200
是的。
Yes.

157
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,899
由于森林砍伐和其他开发，
Because of deforestation and other exploitations,

158
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,659
它们的栖息地减少了。
their habitat has decreased.

159
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,649
由于环境的破坏，
Due to environmental destruction,

160
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:43,000
比如非法捕鱼、海洋污染和二氧化碳的大量排放，
such as illegal fishing, ocean pollution and massive emissions of carbon dioxide,

161
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:48,539
现在我们的星球上至少有15000种野生动物
now there are at least 15,000 species of wildlife on our planet

162
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,039
有灭绝的危险。
that are in danger of extinction.

163
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,960
这些动物要消失了……
These animals are going to disappear...

164
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,080
是的，人类的罪行…
Yeah, the crime of human beings...

165
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:03,840
我们人类是有罪的生物。
We humans are sinful beings.

166
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:06,179
人类的罪行……
The crime of human beings...

167
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,120
是的……
Yep...

168
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:13,899
但是，人类和动物应该共享地球。
But, human beings and animals should be sharing the earth.

169
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:14,740
呃……
Eh...

170
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:16,639
我们一定能做些什么。
There must be something we can do.

171
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:18,120
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

172
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:20,220
嗯…我不知道。
Well...I don't know.

173
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,960
但我不能不管它。
But I can't leave it alone.

174
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:25,299
我不能不管它!
I can't leave it alone!

175
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,539
是的,完全正确!
Yes, exactly!

176
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,679
我们应该能做些什么。
There should be something we can do.

177
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:42,019
青山……顺便说一下，那个时候……
Aoyama...By the way, at that time...

178
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,779
我也觉得你有点孤独……
I also felt you're a little lonely...

179
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:56,159
最后。
Finally.

180
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,320
是的。
Yes.

181
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,580
嗯! ?
Huh!?

182
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,500
嗯! ?
Huh!?

183
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,240
嗯?
Huh?

184
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,620
怎么了?
What's wrong?

185
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,179
——青山吗?——哇!
- Aoyama? - Wow!

186
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:31,700
我很抱歉!
I'm sorry!

187
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,240
啊,不…
Ah, no...

188
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,820
嗯…
Well...

189
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,860
I-I-I摔倒了。
I-I-I fell down.

190
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:39,860
嗯?
Huh?

191
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,019
现在,这种方式!
Now, this way!

192
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:43,879
啊,什么?
Ah, what?

193
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:45,460
青山!

194
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,539

00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:52,299
现在,这种方式!
Now, this way!

196
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:53,840
等待。我们要去哪里?
Wait. Where are we going?

197
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,720
你去前进!
Forward you go!

198
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,120
这是……?
Here is...?

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,259
新项目,开始!

200
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,740
什么?

207
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,080
感谢上帝。
Thanks god.

208
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,379
我…
I...

209

我来找你，你就躺在这里。
I came looking for you and you was lying down here.

210
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:48,220
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

211
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:49,519
啊,我很好。
Ah, I'm fine.

212
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,220
紧急警铃似乎被误启动了。
The emergency bell seems to have been activated by mistake.

213
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,659
让我们回去。你看起来气色不好。我送你回家吧。
Let's go back. You don't look well. Let me take you home.

214
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,960
桃宫，我们得走了。

哦不，哦不，哦不!朝我来了，朝我来了。
Oh no, oh no, oh no! It's coming at me, it's coming at me.

你比你看起来要重。

我的名字是Shirogane Ryou。

是你给我的票吗?
You are the one who gave me the tickets?

243
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,139
战斗?我吗?
Fight? Me?

244
00:16:56,299 --> 00:16:59,259
是的。如果我们不打败这个Chinera阿尼玛，
Yes. If we don't defeat this Chinera Anima,

245
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,419
他会有危险的!
he will be in danger!

246
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,940
拥有你初吻的人受伤了可以吗?

我摔倒的时候不小心亲了一下。
It was just an accidental k-kiss when I fell down.

Well, I've been always fancying about first kiss, but it's all of a sudden.

250
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:14,839
现在不是说这种话的时候!
Now is not the time to say that kind of thing!

251
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,000
诸如此类的事情!?

对于一个女孩来说，初吻是一生只有一次的重要事情!
For a girl, the first kiss is a once-in-a-lifetime important thing!

253
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,500
没错，但是现在……
That is right, but now...

254
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,079
啊~我应该去一个更浪漫的地方约会!
Ah~I should have gone to a more romantic place for a date!

255
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,799
手牵手，凝视彼此的眼睛!在那之后还有许多其他的事情!但是…
Hand in hand, gazing into each others' eyes! And many other things after that! But...

256
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:30,400
-你怎么补偿?-不是我毁了它!
- How can you compensate that? - Not me who ruined it!

257
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,400
这两个可以吗?
Will it be OK for these two?

258
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,180
好了!
Nice!

259
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,640
我是怎么做到的?
Um, how did I do that?

260
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,380
现在!我相信这句话已经进入了你的脑海。
Now! I'm sure the words have come to your mind.

261
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,799
单词吗?
Words?

262
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,259
即使你说…
Even if you say that...

263
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:17,319
嗯…草莓浆果?
Hmm... Strawberry berry?

264
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,799

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,819
足够了。我正在生气。

266

嘿,嘿。那边的怪物!

267
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,079
你竟敢伤害我的青山!

292
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,279
但是，即使你突然这么说……

我会告诉你一切的。跟我来。

等等!你要带我去哪?

你不能这样做，瑞尤。

嗯?

303
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,940
啊? !
Huh?!

304
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,000
好吧,让我们离开。

305
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,339
我不能!我必须帮助青山。
I can't! And I have to help Aoyama.

306
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:39,700
你要怎么跟他解释你为什么穿成那样?
How are you gonna explain to him why you're dressing like that?

307
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,339
是吗?啊…
Eh? Ah...

308
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,819
别担心。他只是被敲晕了。
Don't worry. He was just knocked unconscious.

309
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:48,940
把他交给我们吧。
Leave him to us.

310
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,079
把他交给我吧。
Leave him to me.

311
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,240
他现在是你的了，Mew Minto。
He's yours now, Mew Minto.

312
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:56,319
现在。一护小姐，请跟我们来。
Now. Miss Ichigo, please come with us.

313
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,420
啊……好吧……
Ah...okay...

314
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:03,019
青山……
Aoyama...

315
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,619
他们要带我去哪?
Where are they gonna take me?

316
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:14,319
我不应该跟着他们……
I shouldn't have followed them...

317
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,460
但是，我不能以这种状态回家。
But, I can't go home in this state.

318
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:21,460
我该怎么办?
What should I do?

319
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,640
这些人可能在计划……
These people might be planning...

320
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,539
把我当实验对象!
to use me as a test subject!

321
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,220
我还没有正式的约会。不!
I haven't had a proper date. No!

322
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,319
现在就让我走!

323
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,160
还我青春!
Give me back my youth!

324
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,500
天啊。你可能真的很吵。
Geez. You can be really noisy.

325
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,500
好了，下车吧。

326
